# Minesweeper-CLI
Made a basic terminal based minesweeper game because I was bored 

Run command:
```sh
$ python3 main.py
```
### How to Play
when in input mode:
- Enter `quit`to exit the game
- Enter `flag` or `open` to change mode
- Enter a number for column and row
- Enter the current mode i.e `flag`,`open` to reset column and row position
